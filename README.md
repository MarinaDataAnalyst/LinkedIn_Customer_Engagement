## Project timeline: 3 months.

## Project breakdown by TASK model
## Situation
- The Case Company has a professional presence on LinkedIn but lacks a consistent strategy, engaging formats, and measurable performance tracking.
- Content was published irregularly, lacked clear targeting, and engagement was low compared to competitors and industry standards.
- Meanwhile, EU regulatory trends (sanctions, whistleblower protection, CSRD, etc.) created a timely opportunity for industry thought leadership, but content wasn’t fully capitalizing on this.

## Task

Based on the initial meeting, the questions asked and the answers received, a project development option was proposed through structuring the publication of posts on LinkedIn. I prepared a presentation on the stages and essence of the project, and also defined the roles, taking into account the motivation of the other 2 team members.

**Identified target:**  to improve Marketing and Sales and attract  premium customers.
**Budget:** 0, limited tools.

**To-to list**

*	Audit and analyze existing LinkedIn content and performance
*	Benchmark activity and engagement levels vs key competitors and followers
*	Create a sustainable, branded content strategy with clear messaging and post formats
*	Launch new weekly formats and define a realistic publishing rhythm
*	Ensure content was both compliant and engaging, while increasing visibility
*	Lay the groundwork for long-term content tracking and performance analysis

**Roles:**
- my role is a leader, communication with the client, data scraper and analyst
- the role of the second participant is a data analyst (based on his own motivation)
- the role of the third participant is a digital marketing specialist

 
Data was processed from LinkedIn Analytics. In general I did 13 projects. The final project included 3 parts: main Exploratory and giving insights and summary project with visualisation in Tableau and presentation of thoughts in PowerPoint, then A/B tests and SQL query tasks.

## Action
**1.	Data Audit & Research**
*	Reviewed 1 year of LinkedIn analytics
*	Analyzed top posts by impressions, clicks, engagement
*	Benchmarked against 9 competitors and followers audiences
*	Reviewed Google Analytics and Bing performance on selected content

**2.	Strategic Content Planning**
*	Proposed a content calendar (3 posts/week: Tue – Hot Topic,  Wed – Legal Gym™, Fri – Light post)
*	Designed the relaunch of the Legal Gym™️ weekly series (2 types: carousels and plain posts)
*	Introduced Hot Topics Tuesday for timely legal alerts
*	Provided recommendations on how to integrate subscription plans into content and CTA

**3.	Execution**
*	Drafted 20+ posts ahead of schedule, including carousels, visuals, and calls-to-action
*	Created posts in multiple tones (company voice, personal profile tone, educational, soft CTA)
*	Proposed optimized scheduling to avoid oversaturation
*	Created branded post templates and lead magnets (e.g., carousels, CTA)

**4.	Performance Monitoring**
*	Analyzed engagement patterns week by week (LinkedIn Analytics)
*	Provided insight that a 4-day consecutive posting reduced visibility
*	Suggested replacing soft Friday posts with targeted webinar reminders when needed
*	Maintained a live content tracker in Excel to ensure transparency and collaboration
*	Designed Feedback Google Form

**Used  tools and skills:**
* Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, re, scipy, translator);
* csraping non-sensitive public data from LinkedIn pages using free tool Data Scraper
* Extracting and cleansing Data;
* Exploratory Data Analysis, decomposing;
* A/B testing;
* Statistical Data Analysis;
* Data visualisation;
* Persona's identification and mapping;
* content ideation;
* content creation using chat GPT

✅**Achieved results (so far):**
* Consistent content strategy aligned with company goals
* Audience engagement increased in Legal Gym™ posts
* Improved impression-to-click ratio (quality of engagement > volume)
* Renewed company interest in proactive posting (e.g. use of planned materials by partners)
* Delivered internal presentation with insights, best practices, and live content plan
* Built foundation for long-term performance-driven content development
* add
