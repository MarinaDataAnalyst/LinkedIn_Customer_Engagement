## Project Timeline  
**Duration:** 3 months

---

## 1. Situation  
- The Case Company maintained a LinkedIn presence but lacked:  
  - A consistent publishing strategy  
  - Engaging post formats  
  - Measurable performance tracking  
- Content was irregular, untargeted, and under-performed versus industry benchmarks.  
- Ongoing EU regulatory changes (sanctions, whistleblower protection, CSRD, etc.) presented an opportunity for thought-leadership that was not fully leveraged.

---

## 2. Task  
**Objective:** Develop and implement a structured, measurable LinkedIn publishing strategy focused on EU regulatory trends to:  
1. Strengthen the company’s expert image  
2. Increase audience engagement  
3. Lay groundwork for long-term analytics and optimization  

**Scope & Constraints:**  
- Budget: €0 (limited tools)  
- Team:  
  - **Me (Project Lead):** Strategy, research, data collection, analysis, content creation, stakeholder communication  
  - **Data Analyst:** Assisted with LinkedIn analytics, interim reports, draft content  
  - **Digital Marketer:** Participated in initial meetings; did not contribute to execution  

**Key Deliverables:**  
- Audit of existing content and performance data  
- Competitive benchmark analysis  
- Branded content calendar and templates  
- Weekly content formats (Tue/Wed/Fri)  
- Performance dashboard and slide deck with insights  
- Recommendations for A/B testing, feature collection, and predictive modeling

|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `Analysis` | Jupyter notebooks with initial data audits, cohort comparisons, statistical tests, and final results |

## 7. Team Reflections

- **Initial setup:** The project started with three participants; one stepped away early due to shifting priorities.  
- **Effort distribution:** Of the remaining two, the Project Lead drove the majority of the deep analysis and strategy, with the other member providing valuable support on specific tasks.  
- **Contributions breakdown:**  
  - **Project Lead (Myself):**  
    - Refined a broad challenge into a focused 3-month plan  
    - Conducted all core analyses (cohort comparisons, statistical testing, Q–Q plots, bootstrap intervals)  
    - Developed the content strategy, drafted and designed post templates, and produced the final copy  
    - Created all presentations, led team discussions, and communicated results to the client  
    - Oversaw performance monitoring, interpreted LinkedIn metrics, and documented insights  
    - Coordinated team activities, maintained scope control, and ensured timely delivery  
  - **Team Member:**  
    - Provided LinkedIn analytics in the form of an internal report using LinkedIn-generated charts  
    - Supported content creation by reviewing drafts and offering suggestions  
    - Contributed high-level observations on engagement trends  

Despite different focus areas, both contributors played a role in delivering a clear, data-driven LinkedIn strategy with measurable improvements in engagement. I’m proud of how we turned an ambitious goal into concrete results within a tight timeframe, while fostering collaboration and maintaining project scope.
