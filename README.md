## Project timeline: 3 months.

## Project breakdown by TASK model
## Situation
- The Case Company has a professional presence on LinkedIn but lacks a consistent strategy, engaging formats, and measurable performance tracking.
- Content was published irregularly, lacked clear targeting, and engagement was low compared to competitors and industry standards.
- Meanwhile, EU regulatory trends (sanctions, whistleblower protection, CSRD, etc.) created a timely opportunity for industry thought leadership, but content wasn’t fully capitalizing on this.

## Task

Based on the initial meeting, the questions asked and the answers received, a project development option was proposed through structuring the publication of posts on LinkedIn. I prepared a presentation on the stages and essence of the project, and also defined the roles, taking into account the motivation of the other 2 team members.

**Identified target:**  Develop and implement a structured LinkedIn publishing strategy – regular, targeted and measurable content on current EU regulatory trends – to strengthen the company’s expert image and increase engagement.
**Budget:** 0, limited tools.

**To-to list**

*	Audit and analyze existing LinkedIn content and performance
*	Benchmark activity and engagement levels vs key competitors and followers
*	Create a sustainable, branded content strategy with clear messaging and post formats
*	Launch new weekly formats and define a realistic publishing rhythm
*	Ensure content was both compliant and engaging, while increasing visibility
*	Lay the groundwork for long-term content tracking and performance analysis

**Roles:**
- my role is a project lead, strategist, researcher, data collector/scraper and analyst, project communicator and main content creator.
- 2nd role participant is a data analyst (based on his own motivation). Assisted with LinkedIn analytics review, contributed to interim reporting, and supported the preparation of content drafts under guidance.
- the role of the third participant is a digital marketing specialist (based on his own motivation). Participated in early-stage meetings without input, quited the project and did not contribute to the execution phase

I acted as the Project Lead and main strategic driver behind the LinkedIn performance and content optimization initiative.
My role included project scoping, research design, direct client communication, data collecting and analysis, content strategy development, and post creation.
I also coordinated the team’s work, assigned tasks, and ensured delivery timelines.
In addition to building the overall structure and analytics framework, I independently conducted the Bing research, follower post data collection and sentiment analysis, analysed data on targets and mapped client personas, and proposed the final content calendar and CTA testing plan.
One team member contributed to performance reporting and LinkedIn analytics, while another exited early without completing assigned deliverables.

## Action
**1.	Data Audit & Research**
*	Reviewed 1 year of LinkedIn analytics (2nd role at the beginning, 1st role at the and including analysing posting campaign and comparing periods, given in )
*	Analyzed top posts by impressions, clicks, reactions and engagement
*	Benchmarked against nine competitors and followers audiences (1st role)
*	Reviewed Google Analytics and Bing performance on selected content

**2.	Strategic Content Planning**
*	Proposed a content calendar (3 posts/week: Tue – Hot Topic,  Wed – Educational Content based on Company Invented Trademark Legal Gym™, Fri – Light post)
*	Designed the relaunch of the Legal Gym™️ weekly series (2 types: carousels and plain posts)
*	Introduced Hot Topics Tuesday for timely legal alerts
*	Provided recommendations on how to integrate subscription plans into content and CTA

**3.	Execution**
*	Drafted 20+ posts ahead of schedule, including carousels, visuals, and calls-to-action, suggested video posts content
*	Created posts in multiple tones (company voice, personal profile tone, educational, soft CTA: 3 options)
*	Proposed optimized scheduling to avoid oversaturation based on analytics
*	Created branded post templates and lead magnets (e.g., carousels, CTA)

**4.	Performance Monitoring**
